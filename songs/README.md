# EJMusic's old songs

### A bit of background
I was bored in the mini-lockdown of early 2021, so whenever I had free time, I used to work on a song. I ended up making roughly a song *every day* (which means they weren't the best). I made them on Garageband for iOS, so the songs weren't going to be very high quality anyway.
